The results of the Two-Way ANOVA for the period prior to the implementation of the law indicate a statistically significant difference in drug-related deaths between males and females (F(1, 120) = 182.13, p < .001). This strongly suggests that the difference in means between the two groups is not due to random chance; in general, men are more likely to die from drug-related causes than women.

The effect of Occurrence State on drug-related deaths is not significant (F(2, 120) = 2.51, p = .09). The p-value is just above the conventional threshold of .05, indicating that there may be a trend that warrants further investigation.

The interaction between Gender and Occurrence State is also not significant (F(2, 120) = 2.27, p = .11). Therefore, it is assumed that the effect of gender on drug-related deaths does not vary significantly depending on the occurrence state.
