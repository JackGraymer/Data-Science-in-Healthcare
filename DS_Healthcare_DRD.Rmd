library(dplyr)

setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path)) #setting directory

```

```{r load ds_drug_related_deaths}
Data <- read_excel("data/Drug_related_Deaths_2018-2024.xlsx")

# Overview for the Data
head(Data, 10)
str(Data)

```
```{r Data Explorations}

# look into Notes
unique(Data$Notes)

# only NA's so we delete this column
Data <- Data %>% select(-Notes)

# look into Dates
unique(Data$Month)

# Delete Row Sep., 2024 since the data is not complete
Data <- Data[Data$Month != "Sep., 2024 (provisional and partial)", ]

# Create column Provisional (TRUE/FALSE) based on the col Month '(provisional)'
Data$Provisional <- grepl("\\(provisional\\)", Data$Month)

# Delete " (provisional)" from the Date
Data$Month <- gsub(" \\(provisional\\)", "", Data$Month)

# Dates are formated different (with or without dots/ spaces), so we work with Month Code and format it into Date
Data$`Month Code` <- as.yearmon(Data$`Month Code`, format = "%Y/%m")
Data$Month <- Data$`Month Code`

# look into Deaths
Data$Deaths


# Some of the numbers are "Suppressed" this means that there are between 1 and 9 cases
# To use Deaths as a number we can leave them as NA's or substitute by a random number between 1 and 9

# Set seed for reproducibility if needed
set.seed(23)  

# Replace "Suppressed" in the Death column with a random number between 1 and 9
Data$Deaths <- ifelse(Data$Deaths == "Suppressed", sample(1:9, sum(Data$Deaths == "Suppressed"), replace = TRUE), Data$Deaths)
Data$Deaths <- as.numeric(Data$Deaths)

# Delete all columns that end on Code, they are duplicates of the other columns
Data <- Data[, !grepl("Code$", names(Data))]

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
