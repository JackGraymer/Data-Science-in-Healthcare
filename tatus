The absence of such an interaction implies that the law did not have a measurable effect on drug-related deaths.

 To ensure the robustness of our findings,  Placebo tests will be applied by using the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model to periods before the policy change (e.g., using a fictitious policy change date) to check if similar trends are observed. This helps confirm that the observed effects are not due to random fluctuations. If the placebo test shows no significant impact, it strengthens the validity of the actual policy analysis.[m

To improve the model's predictive accuracy, additional data, such as socioeconomic variables or more detailed health intervention metrics, and more advanced forecasting techniques, may be needed to capture the full scope of the policy's impact on drug-related deaths in the state.[m

[32m+[m[32mThe panel data analysis provides a comprehensive view of the impact of the policy change on drug-related deaths in Oregon. The model estimates the effect of the policy by comparing the current death rate with the lagged death rate, accounting for state-specific trends and variations. The results show a significant positive coefficient for the lagged death rate, indicating a strong association between past and current death rates. This suggests that the policy change may have influenced the trajectory of drug-related deaths in Oregon, as reflected in the model's predictions.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mThe fitted values from the panel data model align closely with the actual death rates, indicating that the model effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data. The visual representation of the model results shows the actual death rates (solid lines) and the fitted values (dashed lines) for each state over time. The close alignment between the two lines demonstrates the model's ability to predict the observed trends accurately.[m

 [m
[31m-The analysis of drug-related deaths in Oregon before and after the 2021 decriminalization policy change reveals a significant increase in deaths following the policy implementation. The Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, Placebo Test and Regression Discontinuity Analysis, all support the conclusion that the policy change had a measurable impact on drug-related deaths in Oregon. The ARIMA time-series forecasting model provides insights into future trends, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and intervention to address the rising death rates.[m

 While the results suggest a causal relationship between the policy change and increased deaths, it is essential to consider external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic influences that may confound the analysis. By incorporating additional variables and refining the models, future research can provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics underlying drug-related deaths and inform targeted interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of substance abuse.[m
